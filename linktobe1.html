	<p> Rio de Janeiro is in the Southern Hemisphere which means New Year’s Eve is summertime, bringing party-goers to the beach. <span>In fact, over two million (many of which wear white as it’s said to bring good luck) head to famous Copacabana, a 2.5-mile stretch of sand to enjoy Champagne, samba and fireworks. The party on the waterfront includes huge stages with live music, extravagant Carnival-style costumes, traditional dance performances and carnival attractions throughout the evening</span>. Handfuls of flowers are tossed into the ocean as a gift to Yemanja, the Goddess of the seas, and during the countdown to 20.</p>
